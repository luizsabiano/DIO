![Avatar](images/fotoRosto2_reduzido.jpg) | I'm a father and a husband, <br/>I love my family. <br/> I'm postal attendant at post office where I work for eight hours a day.

<br/>


In my rest I make an effort to learn as much technology as I can, among them are:

- Python and Django Framework
- Javascript and Framework Vuejs
- Java and Framework Spring
- Android and kotlin
- containerizing in Docker,  and so on

## For the future I intend to learn programing good practices as:
- Clean code
- Clean architecture
- agile methodology as scrum, kaban among others
- TDD - Test Driven Development

I confess that it's extremely difficult to keep myself up to date not working with technology, but I do my best.

#### In this project I will put the result of my challenges, what were the difficulties founded and what I did to overcome them.
